<p>One of the duties of the Dryad Senior curator is to generate weekly reports for journals integrated with Dryad.
 This had become a very time consuming task since the number of integrated journals had grown.
 (There are now about 137 integrated journals.)
  Curators entered information in a spreadsheet as they completed curation.
  The Senior curator would manually count submissions and create individual emails.
  The process would typically take about an entire day each week.
  Given the heavy volume of submissions, this was a huge time investment.</p>
